# From Bamboo to All

---

A nameless god has given you a task: rebuilding an empty world

This task could sound easy, but you know the path itself will not be. You'll need to introduce yourself into [Botanical skills](https://modrinth.com/mod/botania) and progress your [Color knowledge](https://modrinth.com/mod/spectrum) to adquire more complex materials, best suited for certain enviroments of your new world.

At each point of your journey you are expected to build contraptions with the objective of easen the obtention of mundane materials, so you can build the world as you like or just something to call home.
